## Table of Contents
1. Greeting Function
2. Basic Arithmetic Operations
3. String Formatting
4. List Manipulation
5. Dictionary Usage
6. Control Flow with Conditionals
7. Simple Grade Averaging
8. Basic Calculator with User Input

## Features

- **Greeting Function**: Learn how to define and call simple Python functions.
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform arithmetic operations using Python operators.
- **String Manipulation**: Explore string formatting using f-strings.
- **List and Dictionary Operations**: Work with essential data structures.
- **Control Flow**: Practice using if-else statements for conditional logic.
- **Grade Averaging**: Calculate student grades using Python functions and dictionaries.
- **Basic Calculator**: Build a simple calculator that takes user input and performs arithmetic operations with error handling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or a compatible Python IDE

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Song-Yu-0128/Yu-Song.git

## Install Dependencies: No additional dependencies are required other than Python 3.6 or later. However, it is recommended to install a Jupyter Notebook environment for running the .ipynb file.

To install Jupyter Notebook: pip install notebook

## Run the Notebook:

Open the python exercise (1).ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.
Execute each cell to interact with the exercises.

## How to Use
Each section of the notebook is independent, allowing you to run one task at a time.
Modify and experiment with the code by changing variables, adding new functions, and practicing the exercises provided in each section.
