# Python Basics Exercise Notebook

This notebook contains exercises designed to practice fundamental Python programming concepts. It is structured with progressively challenging tasks that introduce functions, data manipulation, user input, and basic logic. Below is a breakdown of the content covered in this notebook.

## Table of Contents

1. **Greeting Function**
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
3. **String Formatting**
4. **Working with Lists**
5. **Working with Dictionaries**
6. **Control Flow with Conditionals**
7. **Simple Grade Averaging**
8. **Basic Calculator with User Input**

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or later.
- A Jupyter Notebook environment or an IDE supporting Jupyter.
  
Alternatively, you can convert the notebook to a `.py` script and run it in any Python environment.

## Exercise Descriptions

### 1. Greeting Function
This exercise defines a simple function `print_greeting()` that prints a greeting message: "Hello, Python! I am Yu Song."

### 2. Basic Arithmetic Operations
This section performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using two predefined variables `a` and `b`.

### 3. String Formatting
The task introduces Python's formatted string literals (f-strings) to dynamically insert a user's name into a greeting message.

### 4. Working with Lists
A list of universities is defined, and operations are performed to access the first and last elements of the list.

### 5. Working with Dictionaries
The notebook explores how to store and retrieve data from a dictionary. A dictionary representing a student's information (name, age, and grade) is created and displayed.

### 6. Control Flow with Conditionals
This exercise covers conditional statements to calculate and display whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 7. Simple Grade Averaging
A dictionary is created to store student names and their respective grades across multiple subjects. A function `print_average_grades()` is used to calculate and print each student's average grade.

### 8. Basic Calculator with User Input
A basic calculator program takes user input (two numbers and an operator), performs the desired operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and prints the result. The function includes error handling for division by zero and invalid operators.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Notebook**  
   Download the notebook from the repository or clone the project to your local environment.

2. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open the notebook in Jupyter or another environment, and run each cell sequentially. Each section is independent and can be executed on its own.

3. **Modify and Experiment**  
   Feel free to modify the variables or add your own functions and code to practice further. This is a hands-on way to solidify the understanding of Python basics.
