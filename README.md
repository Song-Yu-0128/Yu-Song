## Overview

This repository contains Python programming exercises covering topics such as:

- Arithmetic operations
- String manipulation
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.)
- Control flow (if-else statements, loops)
- Functions and modular programming
- File handling and exception management
- Basic object-oriented programming

The exercises are presented in Jupyter Notebook format, making them interactive and ideal for both beginners and intermediate learners.
